# ansible_learn
Ansible is a tool for automating administration tasks and infrastructure configuration. With it, you can:

Install and configure software on servers,
Manage configurations,
Orchestrate application deployments,
Execute commands on multiple machines simultaneously.
Key features of Ansible:

Agentless – No need to install special software on target machines; SSH access is sufficient (or WinRM for Windows).
Simplicity – Scripts are written in YAML as so-called playbooks, making them easy to read even for beginners.
Idempotency – Ansible ensures the system reaches the desired state without unnecessary actions (e.g., it won’t reinstall already installed software).
Extensibility – You can write custom modules in Python or use ready-made modules from a large catalog.
